# Alcodetect

In recent times, a significant proportion of road accidents are attributed to driving under the influence of alcohol, posing a grave threat to public safety. To address this pressing issue, we present a novel project that employs advanced sensing technology to detect alcohol consumption by drivers and takes decisive actions to prevent impaired individuals from operating a vehicle. Our system utilizes alcohol sensors to analyze gaseous materials in the breath of the driver, providing a non-intrusive and reliable means of monitoring sobriety. The core of our solution is an Arduino-based controller that interfaces with the vehicle's engine control system. The controller is strategically positioned on the steering wheel, in proximity to the driver's breath. When the system detects alcohol levels exceeding a predefined threshold, it promptly sends a command to immobilize the vehicle's engine, thereby mitigating the risk of accidents caused by impaired driving.
